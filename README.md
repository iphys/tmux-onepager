# tmux-onepager

This is a one-pager ODP/PDF document about [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux)
terminal multiplexer. It has basic information about tmux, sufficiently for
very basic uses. It is not intended to cover everything about tmux.

Files are distributed under the MIT license.

The OpenDocument Presentation file `tmux-*.odp` is editied in Google Slides,
and it is saved as PDF to generate `tmux-*.pdf`.  Then they are included in
this Git repo.

In addition to the one-pager docs, a few other files are included:

- A tmux configuration file `.tmux.conf`, which is simple and small.
  To use it, put it in your home directory.
- A mini utility shell script `hhmm`, which displays the hour and time for
  a specified location.

For more extensive customization, see for example
