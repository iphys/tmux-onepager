# tmux-onepager

This is a one-pager ODP/PDF document about [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux)
terminal multiplexer. It has basic information about tmux, enough for basic uses.
It is not designed for heavy use.

The OpenDocument Presentation file `tmux-*.odp` is editied in Google Slides,
and then it is saved as PDF to generate `tmux-*.pdf`.

In addition to the one-pager docs, a few other files are included:

- A tmux configuration file `.tmux.conf`, which is simple and small.
- A utility shell script `hhmm`, which displays the hour and time for
  a specified location.
